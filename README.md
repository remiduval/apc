## Starter Kit

This starter kit is the recommended starting place for creating Simple Commerce sites. It includes a minimal, boilerplate design which demonstrates most of the features and functionality Simple Commerce has to offer. You're free to make any changes you want, even redesign the whole front-end to build what you need to build.

This repository contains the source code for the starter kit. However, to use Simple Commerce in production, please remember to [purchase a Simple Commerce license](https://statamic.com/simple-commerce).

## Features

* Minimal design
* Step by step checkout process
* Built with TailwindCSS and Alpine.js
* Demonstrates Simple Commerce functionality

## Quick Start

1. Create site & install dependencies

cd bobs-sweet-shop
rm -rf .git

4. Get Started!

## Build Process

This starter kit uses [Laravel Mix](https://laravel.com/docs/master/mix) to build & compile assets. Out of the box, it ships with one stylesheet and one JavaScript file.

* `resources/css/site.css` -> `public/css/site.css`
* `resources/js/site.js` -> `public/js/site.js`

There's also a few commands you can run to compile your assets for various environments.

* `npm run dev` - to compile your assets locally
* `npm run watch` - to compile your assets locally and start a watcher looking out for file changes
* `npm run production` - to compile and minify your assets, ready for production

You can of course customise this setup however you want.
